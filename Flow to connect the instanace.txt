first we need to add the user with > adduser name > passwd name > vi /etc/sudores or visudo > name ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config > allow passwordauthentication yes > reload service of sshd > login as a user and ssh-keygen 
go to the .ssh directory and ssh-copy-id target system path
